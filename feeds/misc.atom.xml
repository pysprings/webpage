recipe&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; and we spent the
time trying to find a way to use APIs and scraping to determine a &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some early questions like &amp;quot;what is a snickerdoodle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;are we looking to
make cookies or look for a way to have them delivered&amp;quot;, one of the big questions
ended up being &amp;quot;what makes a recipe the best?&amp;quot;. After discussing metrics like
highest calorie count or most butter and sugar, we ended up attempting to make
an amalgamated combination recipe - which was interesting but didn't yield a
great result once we realized that the instructions couldn't be averaged and
combined in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second approach we took is to find an API with fewer details but a method
for ranking the complete recipes. This solved the issue of combining instructions with
ingredients and even though it was a less sophisticated solution, it did return
more complete information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there was a lot of learning and much fun was had by all! Thanks to
Ryan for leading the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, we've been working on what we're calling the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pysprings.org/wiki/PySpringsGrandChallenge"&gt;PySprings Grand
Challenge&lt;/a&gt; (working title,
we still need to find a better name) in collaboration with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/pikespeakmakerspace/"&gt;Pikes Peak
Makerspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-the-challenge"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the Challenge?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still working out some of the details but the original inspiration was to
do something similar to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge"&gt;DARPA Grand Challenge&lt;/a&gt; but simple enough and
cheap enough that more regular folks could participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts we have decided on are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robots will be involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The robots will be autonomous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robot &amp;quot;brains&amp;quot; will be programmable in Python (we &lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt; allow other
languages too)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competition will eventually take place in the Mars room at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.spacefoundation.org/about/locations/world-headquarters-and-space-foundation-discovery-center"&gt;Space
Foundation's world headquarters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still figuring out a lot of the details but plan to have a limited (both
in scope and participants) competition in October, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-this-mars-room"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's this Mars room?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mars room is an area of the Space Foundation's museum that has been
built to be a simulation of Mars and they currently use it for some robotics
programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="first picture of mars room" class="align-center" src="https://pysprings.github.io/webpage/images/20150616-marsroom/marsroom1_scaled.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="second picture of mars room" class="align-center" src="https://pysprings.github.io/webpage/images/20150616-marsroom/marsroom2_scaled.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="third picture of mars room" class="align-center" src="https://pysprings.github.io/webpage/images/20150616-marsroom/marsroom3_scaled.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="robots-and-mars-how-can-i-get-involved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Robots and Mars?! How can I get involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, show up for one of the meetings (I use the term meeting loosely to
mean &amp;quot;folks gathering to get things done&amp;quot;)! If you'd rather not wait, feel free
to ask questions on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pysprings.org/mailman/listinfo/members"&gt;the mailing list&lt;/a&gt;, IRC (#pysprings on Freenode),
direct email or meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future meetings will be scheduled on either the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/PySprings/"&gt;PySprings&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/pikespeakmakerspace/"&gt;Pikes Peak Makerspace&lt;/a&gt; meetup pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tournament will be a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament"&gt;round-robin style tournament&lt;/a&gt;
with the winner determined from overall wins (5 matches with each opponent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanks will be due on or before 23:59 on October 20, 2013. The results will be
presented at a to-be-scheduled meetup on Saturday, October 26 2013. To submit a
tank, email your code to pysprings at pysprings dot org. In addition to the code,
please include the following information:&lt;/p&gt;

which is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

and meeting twice a month. We keep seeing new faces and gaining new regulars,
which is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we've been working on as of late is working with a program
called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://realtimebattle.sourceforge.net/"&gt;RealTimeBattle&lt;/a&gt; which is a
simulator where you have &amp;quot;tanks&amp;quot; controlled by programs which battle eachother
on virtual battle fields. One of the cool things about RealTimeBattle is that
it isn't just Python - anything that can read from stdout and write to stdin
can be used to control a tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we're hoping to have a tournament between submitted tanks but we're
still working out good ways to control the tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems we've hit is that RealTimeBattle is relatively inactive and
unless you're running a Debian derivative (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/realtimebattle"&gt;there is a Debian package available&lt;/a&gt;) it's not trivial to
build or install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help make this process easier, I've made a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD"&gt;live image&lt;/a&gt;
that already has RealTimeBattle, some editors and python utilities pre-installed.
These images are based on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fedoraproject.org/"&gt;Fedora 19&lt;/a&gt; and use the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.xfce.org/"&gt;XFCE&lt;/a&gt; desktop environment. All you have to do is download
the image and either run it in a virtual machine or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_and_use_Live_USB"&gt;prepare it to boot on your
computer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These images are very much a work in progress and feedback would be very much
appreciated. The only way these images will get better is through testing and
finding out if anything is missing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signatures are all done with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;amp;search=0xA1FF95F89D9C6F26"&gt;my GPG key&lt;/a&gt;

add or improve. If you have ideas, feel free to bring them up - we have our own
VPS now and outside of system resources, there isn't much we couldn't do if someone
wanted to get it done. Suggestions are welcome and patches are even more welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Using OpenID or Persona for wiki auth instead of locally stored auth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited about the new site - the plan is to have everything from the blog
posts and css to the configuration management tools available publicly, so expect
more posts and probably some presentations about it in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in poking at the main site, it is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/tflink/pysprings-website"&gt;available on on bitbucket&lt;/a&gt;. Patches and collaboration
are very much encouraged - if you have questions, feel free to ask them on the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pysprings.org/mailman/listinfo/members"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. I may move
everything to github once the site stabilizes but for now, it'll stay on bitbucket.&lt;/p&gt;

an hour and a half&amp;quot; type of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we had so many environment setup issues last time, I'm planning to have
environments and livecds ready for people who don't already have python set up.
If you think that you'd like to use a pre-set environment, please let me know -
the hardware I have can support 8 at the absolute most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things you'll need setup on your laptop (let us know if you want help setting
things up):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtualenv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flask 0.9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sort of text editor (not notepad or wordpad)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 2.6 or 2.7&lt;/li&gt;

site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't end up having a meeting last month, doing a project night
instead. We're still trying to figure out something new for the website,
but progress has been slow. We first started looking into using
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/laoqiu/pypress/"&gt;pypress&lt;/a&gt; (not the new tornado based fork) but since there seem to be
issues when using the Flask-Theme extension with Flask &amp;gt;= 0.8, it seems
less likely that we'll use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had another project night today, with an emphasis on looking into
static site generators. Instead of repeating everything here, I'm going
to be lazy and just link to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pysprings.org/pipermail/list_pysprings.org/2012-August/000010.html"&gt;the email I sent out earlier&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're planning to have a regular meeting in two weeks on Tuesday, August
28th. I'm not sure what the topic is going to be yet but will be make
another announcement once we get that figured out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've never used Python before, don't worry! Ryan and I will be
showing up at 6:30 to help anyone install Python and we're planning to
spend the first 45 minutes talking about Python tools and Basics. We
have several options for the rest of the time and will go with whatever
the group decides to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pygame.org"&gt;PyGame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercises from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/"&gt;Learn Python the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have food, door prizes and a little bit of Python swag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are planning to show up, please let Ryan or I know by sending an
email to pysprings at pysprings dot org, via twitter (&amp;#64;pysprings) or in
person so that we know how much food to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't make it but want to go, let us know what time would be
better for you. We can't promise to change the time of future meetings
but we do want to make the meetings as accessible as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
